Imagine how sweet his heart must be," thought the crocodile's greedy wife. "I must have the monkey's heart! And I must have it now!" was the command. And the poor crocodile set off to do her bidding.

"Is this the way you repay my friendship? You were going to kill me forgetting the hundreds of days you spent in my company and eating my blackberries. Thank God you are so foolish. Do you really think anyone can have their heart outside their body? My heart is very much within me. And as for you, cruel and ungrateful fellow, you have no heart at all. Now, get off my sight and never come back."

The foolish crocodile sadly went back having lost the monkey's friendship and the endless supply of blackberries.
